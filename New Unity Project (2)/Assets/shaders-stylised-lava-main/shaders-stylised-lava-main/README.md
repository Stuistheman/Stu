## Overview

Voronoi patterns are extremely useful for creating natural cell-like patterns in computer graphics. Unity Shader Graph comes with a Voronoi node, but it doesn't provide enough information about the edges between the cell regions, so you'll need to create a custom node to do so. From there, you can create all kinds of effects, including the lava effect contained in this repository.
